Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts.

We hypothesize that casual connection between spending behaviors and sentiments expressed on social media becomes clearer in the case of the cash handout in Japan. This is because this financial support policy was extensively discussed among citizens on various platforms and Twitter was not an exception. Consumers became relatively more expressive not only about the sentiment to the policy but also plans of how they were going to use the money\n",

However, while the macroeconomic consequences of the policy have been clearly stated, it has been failed to address microscopic mechanism in which how consumers have ended up with behaving such way and what could address their manner of consumption.
